<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>

</div>


<p>The reader of John Evelyn's <i>History of Sabatai Sevi, The Pretended
Messiah of the Jewes</i> or of the <i>History of the Three Late
Famous Impostors</i> (1669) in which it is the most significant part,
discovers a fascinating, if unoriginal, addition to the work of the
great diarist and dilettante, the amateur student of engraving and
trees&mdash;and smoke. Evelyn's work was almost totally derived from
the account of Sir Paul Rycaut, who was from 1661 secretary (and
later consul) for the Levant mercantile company in Smyrna. Rycaut
was in fact responsible for what first-hand reporting there is in the
<i>History</i>, and Evelyn's book preceded by only eleven years Rycaut's
<i>History of the Turkish Empire 1623-1677</i>, where the story first appeared
under the author's own name.</p>

<p>What gives Evelyn's <i>Pretended Messiah</i> its own interest is
partly the immediacy of the news of Sabatai Sevi, and partly the context
in which Evelyn places the story, a context to some extent indicated
in the title, <i>History of the Three Late Famous Impostors</i>.
When the work was published in 1669, Sevi was neither the amusing
curiosity he is likely to be for the modern reader, nor the impertinent
confidence man suggested by Evelyn's "impostor." Evelyn
was reviewing for an English audience one of the great crises in
Jewish history, the career of the man who has been called Judaism's
"most notorious messianic claimant."<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> That career was not entirely
past history in 1669. Sevi lived until 1675, and even after his humiliation
and final banishment in 1673 he could write to his father-in-law
in Salonica that men would see in his lifetime the day of redemption
and the return of the Jews to Zion; "For God hath appointed
me Lord of all Mizrayim."<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Indeed, a remnant of Judaeo-Turkish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii" id="Page_ii">[ii]</a></span>
Shabbethaians called Dönmehs apparently exists in Salonica
to the present day.</p>

<p>Whatever the appeal of Sevi's story may be for modern readers&mdash;as
a mode of fiction, perhaps, or an instance of mass hysteria&mdash;Evelyn's
discovery of an exemplum for religious and political enthusiasts
may seem forced or reductive. In 1669, however, the interest
of Englishmen in Jewish affairs was by no means merely
academic&mdash;or narrowly commercial. There were, it is true, English
sportsmen in 1666 who were actually betting on the Sevi career&mdash;ten
to one that the "Messiah of Ismir" would be crowned King of
Jerusalem within two years. And what was most disturbing about
Sevi to the English nation as a whole was perhaps the disruption
of trade, in which Sevi's father was intimately involved, as the
agent of an English mercantile house. At the height of the furor,
Jewish merchants were dissolving businesses as well as unroofing
their houses in preparation for the return to Jerusalem. But the
prime significance for Evelyn&mdash;perhaps more than for Rycaut&mdash;is
revealed in the instinctive mental connection between Jewish and
Christian history, or ways of thinking about history, on the one
hand, and political realities in England on the other. Only nine
years had passed since the return of Charles II and the displacement
of the Protectorate, with its remarkable Jewish elements. As
for the return of the Christian Messiah and an imminent reign of
the saints, Sevi might well have reminded Evelyn of the English
"impostor," the Quaker Jacob Naylor, whose messianic claims were
publicly examined at Bristol in 1657. Far more important to Englishmen
of the period, however, was the episode involving the mission
of the Amsterdam rabbi Menasseh ben Israel to Cromwell's
England in 1655, a year after Naylor's first appearance.</p>

<p>For two centuries after their expulsion from England by Edward
I&mdash;that is, until the seventeenth century&mdash;Jews either avoided
England entirely or lived there in deliberate obscurity. Some Spanish
and Portuguese Jewish refugees from the Inquisition did arrive
in England; but particularly after the execution for treason of Elizabeth's
physician Roderigo Lopez in 1594, they could remain only
as "Crypto-Jews." It was during the Puritan regime that the Jewish
position in England really improved, and the removal of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii" id="Page_iii">[iii]</a></span>
legal bar dates from the conference summoned by Cromwell in response
to the demands of Menasseh.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> The interest in Rabbinical
literature displayed by learned men like Joseph Scaliger, Johann
Buxtorf, Hugo Grotius, and John Selden, together with a general
Old Testament emphasis in Protestant scriptural study, made Judaism
a more fashionable interest than it had been in previous years.
Cromwell's own encouragement of Menasseh is usually viewed as
an expression of his tolerationist principles and the hope that the
return of Jews to England would aid in extending trade with Spain
and Portugal, and even with the Levant. An additional facet of
his general reception of Menasseh is relevant to Evelyn's <i>Pretended
Messiah</i>. A chief argument in <i>The Humble Address of Menasseh
ben Israel</i> (November 5, 1655) was the Amsterdam rabbi's belief
that since England was the only country rejecting the Jews, their
readmittance would be the signal for the coming of the Messiah.
Fifth-Monarchy enthusiasts recalled the prophecies of <i>Daniel</i> and
<i>Revelations</i> and linked them with the relatively immediate experience
of the Thirty Years' War; motives of mercantile jealousy were
to some extent offset by millenarian anxiety. Indeed, the possibility
of an imminent millennial reign of the saints could be the strongest
kind of argument for showing favor to the Jews. Cromwell all
but proselytized at the meetings of the conference; ultimately, because
of the opposition of commercial interests, he was forced to
dissolve it.</p>

<p>We can perhaps best understand Evelyn's account of Sabatai
Sevi, "the Messiah of Ismir," against this background of English
Protestant millennial thinking, admirably summarized in Michael
Fixler's recent study.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> As Fixler suggests, it was possibly to
discredit the Fifth-Monarchy men that Rycaut first included the account
in what was to become his <i>History of the Turkish Empire</i>.
At any rate, Sevi himself was hardly the mere con-man Rycaut and
Evelyn portray; the mask, indeed, is <i>erepta</i> only with the greatest
of difficulty. Because Rycaut was interested in trade and cultural
<i>mores</i>, his (and consequently, Evelyn's) account neglects features
of the story which are of primary interest to more psychologically
inclined readers. We are told almost nothing, for example, of the
details of Sevi's solitary youth; his physical attractiveness; his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[iv]</a></span>
clear voice as well suited to lascivious Spanish love-songs (interpreted
mystically) as to Psalms; and his early rejection of the
Talmud for the practical Cabala, with its strenuous, self-mortifying
asceticism. One would gather from Evelyn that only the deluded
followers of the "impostor" and not Sevi himself imposed such punishments
as self-burial, and bathing in the sea, even in midwinter.
More surprising, perhaps, is the almost total neglect of Sarah, Sevi's
third wife, mentioned in the <i>Pretended Messiah</i> only as the "Ligornese
Lady" whom Sevi acquired after freeing himself "from the
Incumbrances of a Family." In fact, the beautiful and engaging
Sarah seems to have become an integral part of the movement, a
movement which in its early stages was all-male. A prostitute notorious
in her own right, primarily for her claims to be the destined
bride of the Messiah, Sarah apparently escaped miraculously from
a Christian convent after being cared for as an orphan of the savage
Chmielnicki massacres in Poland. As he was later to do with
a more formidable rival to his exclusive claims (Nehemiah ha-Kohen,
who ultimately exposed him as a fraud) Sevi called Sarah to Cairo
in 1664, claiming to have dreamed of her as <i>his</i> future bride. Eventually,
after his "conversion," she followed him even into the Turkish
seraglio where he bore the title Mahmed Effendi.</p>

<p>Other details are missing from Evelyn's <i>Pretended Messiah</i>;
the interested reader may pursue the strange tale in Graetz's <i>History
of the Jews</i> or the partly fictionalized biography by Joseph
Kastein, <i>The Messiah of Ismir</i>.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> We may note in passing one additional
incident. After his first banishment from Smyrna (as a result
of pronouncing the sacred tetragrammaton in Hebrew), Sevi
met the mystic Abraham ha-Yakini, who subsequently forged in archaic
characters and style a document entitled "The Great Wisdom
of Solomon"&mdash;a document accepted by Sevi as an authentic "archeological"
revelation. The event was shortly followed by a bizarre
celebration of Sevi's marriage as the Son of God ("En Sof") with
the Torah, and may have provided climactic metaphysical confirmation
of Sevi's hopes. In the manner of the old apocalypses, it pronounced
Sevi the "saviour of My people, Israel," one who in time
"shall overthrow the great dragon and kill the serpent."<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>Good as Evelyn's <i>Pretended Messiah</i> may have been for contemporaries<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[v]</a></span>
as a review of recent "news," and we must not underestimate
this function, to the modern reader it seems closer to fiction,
of a peculiarly propagandistic and ironic kind. Aside from
omissions from the story&mdash;partly a matter of ignorance or failure in
perception, and partly deliberate exclusion of inconvenient material&mdash;Evelyn's
enthusiastic acceptance of his source's frequent theatrical
metaphors is one measure of the distance from history of the
<i>Pretended Messiah</i>. When Evelyn's Sevi is grave, it is a "formal
and pharisaical gravitie" which is "starcht on." His motives in
general seem highly conscious, even deliberate; and despite a certain
doubleness in the point of view of the <i>Pretended Messiah</i>, the
reason for Sevi's comic simplicity is not difficult to discover. Sir
Paul Rycaut, as I have suggested, seems primarily interested in the
effects of the movement on trade. The most vehement thinking of
the book, though ascribed to an unnamed opponent of Sevi, could
well be that of Rycaut himself:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>[The opponent observed] in what a wilde manner the
whole People of the Jewes was transported, with the
groundless beliefe of a <i>Messiah</i>, leaving not onely their
Trade, and course of living, but publishing Prophesies
of a speedy Kingdome, of rescue from the Tyranny of the
Turk, and leading the Grand Signior himself Captive in
Chaines; matters so dangerous and obnoxious to the
State wherein they lived, as might justly convict them of
Treason and Rebellion, and leave them to the Mercy of
that Justice, which on the least jealousie and suspicion
of Matters of this nature uses to extirpate Families, and
subvert the Mansion-houses of their own People, much
rather of the Jewes, on whom the Turkes would gladly
take occasion to dispoile them of their Estates, and condemn
the whole Nation to perpetual slavery.</p>

<div class="right">(pp. 78-79)</div>
</div>

<p>Evelyn retains this and similar material, apparently never suspecting
that the Turks may well have been hesitant from real fear; but
the burden of his emphasis is more overtly political and religious.
Evelyn is less than ingenuous, perhaps, in associating Sevi with
Peter Serini's fake brother, or even with Mahomed Bei&mdash;another of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
the "late famous impostors." But the connection does have the
effect of putting Sevi in an imaginary world where all masks will
be discovered and the truth known. Ultimately, Evelyn's Jews,
like Dryden's and Milton's, are English&mdash;"<i>our</i> modern Enthusiasts
and other prodigious Sects amongst us, who Dreame of the like
Carnal Expectations, and a Temporal Monarchy" (sig. A8; italics
mine). One hardly needs to fill out the reading. With a traditional
reminder that "the Time is not yet Accomplished," Evelyn warns
English sectarians to beware of misleading fictions&mdash;"to weigh how
nearly their Characters approach the Style and Design of those
deluded wretches."</p>

<p>Evelyn's words here suggest something of the wider interest
of the <i>Pretended Messiah</i>. For in threatening the modern enthusiasts,
as it were, with the status of comic fiction, he also hinted
at the literal immediacy of such explicitly imaginative works as
<i>Absalom and Achitophel</i>, <i>Paradise Regained</i>, and <i>Samson Agonistes</i>.
What Evelyn's <i>Pretended Messiah</i> helps to reveal, then, is
not only the potential metaphoric value of news itself, but also the
peculiar proximity of poetry to "history" in a period when historical
thought was inseparable from apocalyptic myth.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

would appear but ingrateful in us
to expose them to an </i>Inconvenience<i>.
Let it suffice to assure you,
that they are </i>Persons<i> of no mean
</i>Parts<i>, </i>Ingenuity<i> and </i>Candor<i>;
well acquainted with the </i>Eastern
Countreys<i> and </i>Affaires<i>, and
that have themselves been witnesses
of most of these Transactions.</i></p>

<p><i>It were to be wish'd that our
</i>Christian Monarchs<i> had alwayes
near them some dextrous </i>Person<i>
of this </i>Gentlemans<i> abilites;
were it but to </i>Discover<i> such
</i>Cheates<i> as frequently appearing
under the Disguise of Distressed
</i>Princes<i>, </i>Merchants<i>, &amp;c. are, to</i>
<i>truth, but </i>Spies<i>, and bold </i>Impostors<i>,
and whom otherwise 'tis
almost impossible to </i>detect<i>; not
to suggest the many other good
</i>Offices<i>, as to the </i>Eastern Commerce<i>
and </i>Affaires<i>, they might
be </i>useful<i> in. But this is more
than I have </i>Commission<i> to say
from those who have no other
design in what they </i>Relate<i>, than
their </i>Affection<i> to </i>Truth<i>. It is
not yet a full </i>Year<i> since there
went a Crafty </i>Varlet<i> about the
</i>Countrey<i>, who pretended himself
to be the </i>Brother<i> of the famous
</i>Peter Serini (<i>whose brave
and </i>Heroick Actions<i> had so</i> celebrated
<i>him against the</i> Turkes)
<i>and related a </i>Story<i> by his feign'd
</i>Interpreter<i>, how he fortun'd to be
cast on shore on the </i>West<i> of
</i>England<i>, as he was conducting</i>
Supplies<i> from abroad. </i>This<i> he
perform'd with a confidence and
success so happily, as caus'd him
to be </i>receiv'd, presented, <i>and</i>
assisted (<i>like another </i>Mahomed
Bei) <i>by divers </i>Persons<i> of </i>Quality<i>,
and some of them my nearest
</i>Acquaintance<i>, in his Pretended
Journey to </i>Court<i>; But being at
last discover'd in a </i>Tipling-house<i>
on the </i>Rode<i>, where un-mindful
of his </i>Part<i> and </i>Character<i>, he
call'd for a </i>Pot<i> of </i>Ale<i> in too good
</i>English<i>, and a more natural </i>Tone<i>
than became so great a </i>Stranger<i>,
and the </i>Person<i> he put on, we heard
no more of the </i>Gamester<i>: I wish
our </i>Fin-land Spirit<i>, who is of late
dropt out of the </i>Clouds<i> amongst
us, prove not one of his </i>Disciples<i>;
for the </i>Age<i> is very fertile;
and I am told, that our </i>Mahomed
<i>having receiv'd his </i>Ajuda
de Costo<i> from the Bounty and
Charity of a great </i>Person<i> of more
easie </i>Beliefe<i>, is slipt aside for fear
of the </i>Porters-Lodge<i>, and yet 'tis
</i>possible<i> you may hear more of
him before his </i>Ramble<i> be quite
at a period.</i>
</p>

<p><i>You have at the end of the last
</i>Impostor<i> an </i>Account<i> of the </i>Jews<i>
Exile out of that Vast </i>Empire<i> of
</i>Persia<i>, happening but the other
day; which, together with the
miscarriage of their late </i>Messiah

stands in their own </i>Records)
<i>might, one would think, at last

such who Comment on
the <i>Apocalyps</i>, or Revelations,
this Year of 1666 was to prove
a Year of Wonders, of strange Revolutions
in the World, and particularly
of Blessing to the <i>Jewes</i>, either in respect
of their Conversion to the <i>Christian</i>
Faith, or of their Restoration to their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
Temporal Kingdome: This Opinion
was so dilated, and fixt in the Countreys
of the Reformed Religion, and in
the Heads of Phanatical <i>Enthusiasts</i>,
who Dreamed of a Fift Monarchy, the
downfall of the <i>Pope</i>, and <i>Antichrist</i>,
and the Greatness of the <i>Jewes</i>: In so
much, that this subtile People judged
this Year the time to stir, and to fit
their Motion according to the season of
the Modern Prophesies; whereupon
strange Reports flew from place to
place, of the March of Multitudes of
People from unknown parts into the
remote Desarts of <i>Arabia</i>, supposed to
be the <i>Ten Tribes</i> and <i>halfe</i>, lost for so
many Ages. That a Ship was arrived
in the Northern parts of <i>Scotland</i> with
her Sailes and Cordage of Silke, Navigated
by Mariners who spake nothing
but <i>Hebrew</i>; with this Motto
on their Sailes, <i>The Twelve Tribes of
Israel</i>. These Reportes agreeing thus
near to former Predictions, put the
wild sort of the World into an expectation
of strange Accidents, this year
should produce in reference to the <i>Jewish</i>
Monarchy.</p>

<p>In this manner Millions of People<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
were possessed, when <i>Sabatai Sevi</i> first
appear'd at <i>Smyrna</i>, and published himself
to the <i>Jewes</i> for their <i>Messiah</i>, relating
the greatness of their approaching
Kingdome, the strong hand whereby
God was about to deliver them from
Bondage, and gather them from all
partes of the World. It was strange
to see how the fancy took, and how fast
the report of <i>Sabatai</i> and his Doctrine
flew through all partes where <i>Turkes</i>
and <i>Jews</i> inhabited; the latter of which
were so deeply possessed with a beliefe
of their new Kingdome, and Riches, and
many of them with promotion to Offices
of Government, Renown, and
Greatness, that in all parts from <i>Constantinople</i>
to <i>Buda</i> (which it was my
fortune that year to Travel) I perceiv'd
a strange transport in the <i>Jewes</i>, none of
them attending to any business unless
to winde up former negotiations, and
to prepare themselves and Families for a
Journey to <i>Jerusalem</i>: All their Discourses,
their Dreames, and disposal of
their Affaires tended to no other Design
but a re-establishment in the Land
of Promise, to Greatness, Glory, Wisdome,
and Doctrine of the <i>Messiah</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
whose Original, Birth, and Education
are first to be recounted.</p>

<p><i>Sabatai Sevi</i> was Son of <i>Mordechai
Sevi</i>, an Inhabitant, and Natural of
<i>Smyrna</i>, who gained his Livelihood by
being <i>Broaker</i> to an <i>English</i> Marchant
in that place; a person, who before
his death was very decrepit in his Body,
and full of the Goute, and other Infirmities,
but his Son <i>Sabatai Sevi</i> addicting
himself to Study, became a notable
Proficient in the <i>Hebrew</i> and <i>Metaphysicks</i>;
and arrived to that point of
<i>Sophistry</i> in <i>Divinity</i> and <i>Metaphysicks</i>,
that he vented a New Doctrine in their
Law, drawing to the Profession of it so
many Disciples, as raised one day a Tumult
in the <i>Synagogue</i>; for which afterwards
he was by a Censure of the <i>Chochams</i>
(who are Expounders of the
Law) banished the City.</p>

<p>During the time of his Exile, he
Travelled to <i>Thessalonica</i>, now called
<i>Salonica</i>, where he Marryed a very
handsome Woman; but either not having
that part of Oeconomy as to govern
a Wife, or being Impotent towards
Women, as was pretended, or
that she found not favour in his Eyes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
she was divorced from him: Again,
he took a second Wife, more beautiful
then the former, but the same causes
of discontent raising a difference between
them, he obtained another Divorce
from this Wife also. And being
now free from the Incumbrances of
a Family, his wandring Head mov'd
him to Travel through the <i>Morea</i>, thence
to <i>Tripoli</i> in <i>Syria</i>, <i>Gaza</i>, and <i>Jerusalem</i>;
and by the way picked up a <i>Ligornese</i>
Lady, whom he made his third
Wife, the Daughter of some <i>Polonian</i>
or <i>German</i>, her Original and Parentage
not being very well known. And
being now at <i>Jerusalem</i> he began to
Reforme the <i>Law</i> of the <i>Jewes</i>, and
Abolish the <i>Fast</i> of <i>Tamuz</i> (which
they keep in the Moneth of <i>June</i>) and
there meeting with a certain <i>Jew</i> called
<i>Nathan</i>, a proper Instrument to promote
his Design; he communicated
to him his Condition, his Course of
Life, and Intentions, to Proclaime himself
<i>Messiah</i> of the World, so long expected
and desired by the <i>Jewes</i>. This
Design took wonderfully with <i>Nathan</i>;
and because it was thought necessary
according to <i>Scripture</i>, and Antient <i>Prophesies</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
that <i>Elias</i> was to precede the
<i>Messiah</i>, as St. <i>John Baptist</i> was the
fore-runner of <i>Christ</i>: <i>Nathan</i> thought
no man so proper to Act the Part of
the <i>Prophet</i> as himself; and so no
sooner had <i>Sabatai</i> declared himself the
<i>Messiah</i>, but <i>Nathan</i> discovers himself
to be his Prophet, forbiding all the
Fasts of the <i>Jewes</i> in <i>Jerusalem</i>; and
declaring, that the Bridegroom being
come, nothing but Joy, and Triumph
ought to dwell in their Habitations;
Writing to all the Assemblies of the
<i>Jewes</i>, to perswade them to the same
beliefe.</p>

<p>And now the Schisme being
begun, and many <i>Jewes</i> really believing
what they so much desired, <i>Nathan</i>
took the courage and boldness to
Prophesie, That one Year from the
27th of <i>Kislev</i>, (which is the moneth of
<i>June</i>) the <i>Messiah</i> shall appear before the
<i>Grand Signor</i>, &amp; take from him his Crown
and lead him in Chaines like a Captive.</p>

<p><i>Sabatai</i> also at <i>Gaza</i> Preached Repentance
to the <i>Jewes</i>, and Obedience
to Himself and Doctrine, for that the
coming of the <i>Messiah</i> was at hand:
which Novelties so Affected the <i>Jewish</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
Inhabitants of those partes, that they
gave up themselves wholly to their
Prayers, Almes, and Devotions; and to
confirme this beliefe the more, it hapned,
that at the same time that Newes
hereof, with all perticulars were dispatched
from <i>Gaza</i>, to acquaint the
Brethren in Forrain Partes: The Rumour
of the <i>Messiah</i> hath flown so swift,
and gained such reception, that Intelligence
came from all Partes and Countreys
where the <i>Jewes</i> inhabit, by Letters
to <i>Gaza</i>, and <i>Jerusalem</i>, Congratulating
the happiness of their Deliverance,
and expiration of the time of
their Servitude, by the Appearance of
the <i>Messiah</i>. To which they adjoyned
other Prophesies, relating to that Dominion
the <i>Messiah</i> was to have over all
the World: that for Nine Moneths
after he was to disappeare; during
which time the <i>Jewes</i> were to suffer, and
many of them to undergoe Martyrdom:
but then returning again Mounted on
a C&oelig;lestial <i>Lyon</i>, with his Bridle made
of <i>Serpents</i> with seven heads, accompanyed
with his Brethren the <i>Jewes</i>, who
Inhabited on the other side of the River
<i>Sabation</i>, he should be acknowledged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
for the Sole Monarch of the Universe;
and then the <i>Holy Temple</i> should
descend from Heaven already built, framed,
and beautified, wherein they
should offer Sacrifice for ever.</p>

<p>And here I leave you to consider,
how strangely this Deceived People
was Amused, when these Confident,
and vain Reports, and Dreams of Power,
and Kingdomes, had wholly transported
them from the ordinary course of
their Trade, and Interest.</p>

<p>This noise and rumour of the <i>Messiah</i>,
having begun to fill all places, <i>Sabatai
Sevi</i> resolved to Travel towards <i>Smyrna</i>,
the Country of his Nativity; and
thence to <i>Constantinople</i> the Capital
City, where the principal Work of
Preaching was to have been performed:
<i>Nathan</i> thought it not fit to be
long after him, and therefore Travels by
the way of <i>Damascus</i>, where resolving
to continue some time for better Propagation
of this New Doctrine; in the
meane while Writes this Letter to <i>Sabatai
Sevi</i>, as followeth.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>And now all the <i>Cities</i> of <i>Turky</i>
where the <i>Jewes</i> Inhabited were full of
the expectation of the <i>Messiah</i>; no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
Trade, nor course of Gaine was followed:
every one imagin'd that dayly Provisions,
Riches, Honours, and Government,
were to descend upon them by
some unknown and Miraculous manner:
an example of which is most observable
in the <i>Jewes</i> at <i>Thessalonica</i>,
who now full of Assurance that the Restoration
of their Kingdome, and the
Accomplishment of the time for the
coming of the <i>Messiah</i> was at hand,
judged themselves obliged to double
their Devotions, and Purifie their Consciences
from all Sins and Enormities
which might be obvious to the scrutiny
of him who was now come to Penetrate
into the very Thoughts and Imaginations
of Mankinde. In which
Work certain <i>Chochams</i> were appointed
to direct the People how to Regulate
their Prayers, Fasts, and other Acts
of Devotion. But so forward was every
one now in his Acts of Penance,
that they stay'd not for the Sentence
of the <i>Chocham</i>, or prescription of any
Rules, but apply'd themselves immediately
to Fasting: And some in that
manner beyond the abilities of Nature,
that having for the space of seven dayes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
taken no sustenance, were famished to
death. Others buryed themselves in
their Gardens, covering their naked
Bodies with Earth, their heads onely
excepted, remained in their Beds of dirt
until their Bodies were stifned with the
cold and moisture: others would indure
to have melted Wax dropt upon
their shoulders, others to rowle themselves
in Snow, and throw their Bodies
in the Coldest season of Winter
Into the Sea, or Frozen Waters. But
the most common way of Mortification
was first to prick their Backs and
Sides with Thornes, and then to give
themselves thirty nine Lashes. All
Business was laid aside, none Worked,
or opened Shop, unless to clear his
Warehouse of Merchandize at any
Price: who had superfluity in Houshold-stuffe,
sold it for what he could; but
yet not to <i>Iewes</i>, for they were Interdicted
from Bargaines or Sales, on the
pain of Excommunication, Pecuniary
Mulcts, or Corporal Punishments; for
all Business and Imployment was esteemed
the Test, and Touchstone of
their Faith. It being the general Tenent,
that in the dayes that the <i>Messiah</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
appeares, the <i>Iewes</i> shall become Masters
of the Estates and Inheritance of
<i>Infidels</i>; until when they are to content
themselves with Matters onely necessary
to maintain and support Life.
But because every one was not Master
of so much Fortune and Provision, as to
live without dayly Labour, therefore to
quiet the Clamours of the Poor, and
prevent the Enormous lives of some,
who upon these occasions would become
Vagabonds, and desert their <i>Cities</i>,
due order was taken to make Collections,
which were so liberally bestow'd,
that in <i>Thessalonica</i> onely 400
Poore were supported by the meer charity
of the Richer. And as they indeavour'd
to purge their <i>Consciences</i>
of Sin, and to apply themselves to
good Workes, that the <i>Messiah</i> might
find the City prepared for his Reception;
so, least he should accuse them
of any omission in the Law, and particularly
in their neglect of that Antient
Precept of Increase and Multiply;
they marryed together Children of ten
yeares of age, and some under, without
respect to Riches, or Poverty, Condition
or Quality: But, being promiscuously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
joyned, to the number of 6 or
700 Couple, upon better and cooler
thoughts, after the deceipt of the false
<i>Messiah</i> was discover'd, or the expectation
of his Coming grew cold, were Divorced,
or by Consent separated from
each other.</p>

<p>In the heat of all this Talk and Rumor,
comes <i>Sabatai Sevi</i> to <i>Smyrna</i>,
the City of his Nativity, infinitely desir'd
there by the common <i>Iewes</i>; but
by the <i>Chochams</i>, or <i>Doctors</i> of their
<i>Law</i>, who gave little or no credence to
what he pretended, was ill receiv'd, not
knowing what mischief or ruine this
Doctrine and Prophesie of a New Kingdome
might produce. Yet <i>Sabatai</i>
bringing with him testimonials of his
Sanctity, Holy Life, Wisdom, and Gift
of Prophesie, so deeply fixed himself in
the heart of the Generality, both as
being Holy and Wise, that thereupon
he took courage and boldness to enter
into Dispute with the Grand <i>Chocham</i>
(who is the Head, and Chief Expositer
of the <i>Law</i> and superintendent of their
will and Government) between whom
the Arguments grew so high, and Language
so hot, that the <i>Iewes</i> who favoured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
the Doctrine of <i>Sabatai</i>, and
feared the Authority of the <i>Chocham</i>,
doubtful what might be the issue of
the Contest, appear'd in great numbers
before the <i>Cadi</i> of <i>Smyrna</i>, in justification
of their New Prophet, before
so much as any Accusation came against
him: The <i>Cadi</i> (according to the
Custome of the <i>Turkes</i>,) swallows Mony
on both sides, and afterwards remits
them to the determination of their own
Justice. In this manner <i>Sabatai</i> gaines
ground dayly; and the Grand <i>Chocham</i>
with his Party, losing both the affection
and obedience of his People, is
displaced from his Office, and another
Constituted, more affectionate, and agreeable
to the New Prophet, whose
power daily increased by those confident
Reports. That his Enemies were
struck with Phrensies and Madness, until
being restor'd to their former temper
and wits by him, became his Friends,
Admirers, and Disciples. No Invitation
was now made in <i>Smyrna</i> by the
<i>Iewes</i>, nor Marriage, or Circumcision
solemnized, where <i>Sabatai</i> was not present,
accompanyed with a multitude of
his Followers, and the Streets cover'd<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
with Carpits, or fine Cloath for him to
tread on; but the Humility of this
<i>Pharisee</i> appear'd such, that he would
stoop and turne them aside, and so pass.
And having thus fixed himself in the
Opinion and Admiration of the People,
he began to take on himself the Title
of <i>Messiah</i>, and the <i>Son</i> of <i>God</i>; and to
make this following Declaration to

<i>Sabatai Sevi.</i>
</div>
</div>

<p>Notwithstanding the Disciples of
<i>Sabatai Sevi</i> were not so numerous,
but many opposed his doctrine, publiquely
avouching that he was an <i>Impostor</i>,
and Deceiver of the people,
amongst which was one <i>Samuel Pennia</i>,
a man of a good estate and reputation
in <i>Smyrna</i>, who arguing in the
<i>Synagogue</i>, that the present signs of
the coming of the <i>Messiah</i> were not
apparent, either according to Scripture,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
or the doctrine of the <i>Rabbins</i>, raised
such a sedition and tumult amongst
the <i>Jews</i>, as not onely prevailed against
arguments, but had also against
his life, had he not timely conveyed
himself out of the <i>Synagogue</i>, and
thereby escaped the hands of the multitude,
who now could more easily
endure blasphemy against the <i>Law</i> of
<i>Moses</i>, and the prophanation of the
<i>Sanctuary</i>, than contradiction, or misbelief
of the doctrine of <i>Sabatai</i>. But
howsoever it fell out, <i>Pennia</i> in short
time becomes a convert, and preaches
up <i>Sabatai</i> for the <i>Son</i> of <i>God</i>, and <i>deliverer</i>
of the <i>Jews</i>: and not onely
he, but his whole family; his daughters
prophesie, and fall into strange
extasies; and not onely his house, but
four hundred men and women prophesie
of the growing kingdom of
<i>Sabatai</i>, and young infants who could
yet scarce stammer out a syllable to
their mothers, repeat, and pronounce
plainly the name of <i>Sabatai</i> the <i>Messiah</i>,
and Son of God. For thus farr
had God permitted the devil to delude
this people, that their very children<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
were for a time possessed, and
voices heard to sound from their stomacks,
and intrails: those of riper
years fell first into a trance, foamed at
the mouth, and recounted the future
prosperitie, and deliverance of the <i>Israelites</i>,
their visions of the <i>Lion</i> of
<i>Judah</i>, and the triumphs of <i>Sabatai</i>,
all which were certainly true, being
effects of <i>Diabolical</i> delusions: as the
<i>Jews</i> themselves since have confessed
unto me.</p>

<p>With these concomitant accidents,
and successes, <i>Sabatai Sevi</i> growing
more presumptuous, that he might correspond
with the Prophesies of greatness,
and dominion of the <i>Messiah</i>,
proceeds to an election of those Princes
which were to govern the <i>Israelites</i>
in their march towards the <i>Holy-Land</i>,
and to dispence Judgement and
Justice after their Restoration. The
names of them were these which follow,
men well known at <i>Smyrna</i>, who
never (God knows) had ambition to
aspire to the title of Princes, until a
strange spirit of deceit and delusion
had moved them, not onely to hope<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
for it as possible, but to expect it as
certain.</p>

<p>In this manner things ran to a strange
height of madness amongst the <i>Jews</i>
at <i>Smyrna</i>, where appear'd such pageantry
of greatness, that no Comedy
could equal the mock-shews they
represented, and though none durst
openly profess any scruple, or doubt of
this common received belief, yet for
confirmation of the <i>Jews</i> in their
Faith, and astonishment of the <i>Gentiles</i>,
it was judged no less than necessary
that <i>Sabatai</i> should shew some miracles,
whereby to evince to all the
World that he was the true <i>Messiah</i>:
and as the present occasion seemed to
require an evidence infallible of this
truth, so it was daily expected by the
vulgar, with an impatience sutable to
humors disposed to Noveltie; who
out of every action and motion of their
Prophet began to fancy something
extraordinary and supernatural. <i>Sabatai</i>
was now horribly puzzled for a
Miracle, though the imagination of the
people was so vitiated that any <i>legerdemaine</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
or slight of hand would have
passed more easily with them for a
wonder than <i>Moses</i> striking the rock
for water, or dividing the <i>red sea</i>.
And occasion happening that <i>Sabatai</i>
was, in behalf of his Subjects, to appear
before the <i>Cadi</i>, or judge of the
Citie to demand ease, and relief of
some oppressions which aggrieved
them: It was thought necessary a Miracle
should now or never, when <i>Sabatai</i>
appearing with a formal and <i>pharisaical</i>
gravitie, which he had starcht
on: Some on a sudden avouched to
see a pillar of fire between him and
the <i>Cadi</i>, which report presently was
heard through the whole room, filled
with <i>Jews</i> that accompanied <i>Sabatai</i>,
some of whom, who strongly fancied
it, vow'd, and swore they saw it;
others in the outward yard, or that
could not come near to hear, or see
for the crowd, as speedily took the
alarm, and the rumour ran, and belief
receiv'd by the Women and Children
at home in a moment, so that <i>Sabatai
Sevi</i> returned to his house triumphant,
fixed in the hearts of his people, who
now needed no further Miracles to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
confirm them in their faith. And thus
was <i>Sabatai</i> exalted, when no man
was thought worthy of communication
who did not believe him to be
the <i>Messiah</i>: others were called <i>Kophrim</i>,
infidels or hereticks, liable to
the censure of excommunication, with
whom it was not lawful so much as
to eat: every man produc'd his treasure,
his Gold and Jewels, offering them
at the feet of <i>Sabatai</i>; so that he
could have commanded all the wealth
of <i>Smyrna</i>, but he was too subtil to
accept their money, least he should
render his design suspected by any act
of covetousness. <i>Sabatai Sevi</i> having
thus fully fixed himself in <i>Smyrna</i>, and
filled other places with rumors of his
fame; declared that he was called by
God to visit <i>Constantinople</i>, where the
greatest part of his work was to be
accomplisht; in order whereunto he
privately ships himself, with some few
attendants in a <i>Turkish Saick</i>, in the
Moneth of <i>January</i> 1666. least the
crowd of his disciples, and such who
would press to follow him, should endanger
him in the Eyes of the <i>Turks</i>,
who already began to be scandalized<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
at the reports and prophesies concerning
his person. But though <i>Sabatai</i>
took few into the Vessel to him, yet a
multitude of <i>Jews</i> travell'd over land
to meet him again at <i>Constantinople</i>, on
whom all their Eyes and Expectations
were intent. The wind proving northernly,
as commonly it is in the <i>Helespont</i>
and <i>Propontis</i>; <i>Sabatai</i> was thirtie
nine days in his voyage, and yet
the Vessel not arriv'd, so little power
had this <i>Messiah</i> over the Sea and
Winds, in which time news being
come to <i>Constantinople</i> that the <i>Jews
Messiah</i> was near, all that people prepared
to receive him with the same
Joy and Impatience as was exprest in
other parts where he arrived; the
great <i>Vizier</i> (then also at <i>Constantinople</i>,
being not yet departed on his
expedition for <i>Candia</i>) having heard
some rumors of this man, and the disorder
and madness he had raised amongst
the <i>Jews</i>; sent two Boats,
whil'st the <i>Saick</i> was detained by contrary
winds, with commands to bring
him up Prisoner to the Port, where
accordingly <i>Sabatai</i> being come, was
committed to the most loathsom and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
darkest Dungeon in the Town, there
to remain in farther expectation of the
<i>Viziers</i> sentence: The <i>Jews</i> were not
at all discouraged at this ill treatment
of their prophet, but rather confirmed
in their belief of him, as being the
accomplishment of the prophesie of
those things which ought to precede
his glory and dominion; which consideration
induc'd the chiefest persons
amongst the <i>Jews</i> to make their visits
and addresses to him with the same
ceremony and respect in the Dungeon
as they would have done had he then
sat exalted on the throne of <i>Israel</i>:
several of them, with one <i>Anacago</i>, by
name, a man of great esteem amongst
the <i>Jews</i>, attended a whole day before
him, with their Eyes cast down, their
bodies bending forward, and hands
crost before them (which are postures
of humility, and service in the Eastern
Countreys) the undecency of the
place, and present subjection, not having
in the least abated their high
thoughts, and reverence towards his
person. The <i>Jews</i> in <i>Constantinople</i>
were now become as mad and distracted
as they were in other places, all trade<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
and trafficque forbidden, and those
who owed money, in no manner careful
how to satisfie it: amongst which
wild crew some were indebted to our
Merchants at <i>Galata</i>, who not knowing
the way to receive their money, partly
for their interest, and partly for curiosity
thought fit to visit this <i>Sabatai</i>,
complayning that such particular <i>Jews</i>,
upon his coming, took upon them the
boldness to defraud them of their right,
desired he would be pleased to signifie
to these his Subjects, his pleasure
to have satisfaction given: whereupon
<i>Sabatai</i> with much affectation
took Pen and Paper, and wrote to
this effect.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>To you of the Nation of
the <i>Jews</i>, who expect the
appearance of the <i>Messiah</i>, and
the Salvation of <i>Israel</i>, Peace
without end. Whereas we are
informed that you are indebted
to several of the <i>English</i> Nation:
It seemeth right unto us to enorder
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>you to make satisfaction
to these your just debts: which
if you refuse to do, and not
obey us herein: Know you, that
then you are not to enter with
us into our Joys and Dominions.</p></div>

<p>In this manner <i>Sabatai Sevi</i> remained
a Prisoner at <i>Constantinople</i> for
the space of two Moneths; at the end
of which, the <i>Vizier</i> having designed
his expedition for <i>Candia</i>; and considering
the rumor and disturbance the
presence of <i>Sabatai</i> had made already
at <i>Constantinople</i>, thought it not secure
to suffer him to remain in the Imperial
Citie, whil'st both the <i>Grand Signior</i>
and himself were absent: and therefore
changes his prison to the <i>Dardanelli</i>,
otherwise called the <i>Castle</i> of
<i>Abydos</i>, being on the <i>Europe</i> side of
the <i>Helespont</i>, opposite to <i>Sestos</i>, places
famous in <i>Greek</i> Poetrie. This removal
of <i>Sabatai</i> from a worse Prison to
one of a better air; confirmed the <i>Jews</i>
with greater confidence of his being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
the <i>Messiah</i>, supposing that had it been
in the power of the <i>Vizier</i>, or other
Officers of the <i>Turks</i>, to have destroyed
his person, they would never
have permitted him to have lived to
that time, in regard their <i>Maximes</i> enforce
them to quit all jealousies and
suspitions of ruine to their state by the
death of the party feared, which much
rather they ought to execute on <i>Sabatai</i>,
who had not onely declared himself
the <i>King</i> of <i>Israel</i>, but also published
Prophesies fatal to the <i>Grand
Signior</i> and his Kingdoms.</p>

<p>With this consideration, and others
preceding, the <i>Jews</i> flock in great
numbers to the <i>Castle</i>, where he was
imprisoned, not onely from the neighbouring
parts, but also from <i>Poland</i>,
<i>Germanie</i>, <i>Legorne</i>, <i>Venice</i>, <i>Amsterdam</i>,
and other places where the <i>Jews</i> reside:
on all whom, as a reward of the
expence, and labours of their pilgrimage,
<i>Sabatai</i> bestowed plenty of his
benedictions, promising encrease of
their store, and enlargement of their
Possessions in the <i>Holy-Land</i>. And so
great was the confluence of the <i>Jews</i>
to this place, that the <i>Turks</i> thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
it requisite to make their advantage
thereof, and so not onely raised the
price of their Provision, Lodgings, and
other Necessaries, but also denied to
admit any to the presence of <i>Sabatai</i>,
unless for money, setting the price,
sometimes at five, sometimes at ten
<i>Dollers</i>, or more or less, according as
they guessed at their abilities, or zeal
of the person, by which gain and advantage
to the <i>Turks</i> no complaints
or advices were carried to <i>Adrianople</i>,
either of the concourse of people, or
arguments amongst the <i>Jews</i> in that
place; but rather all civilities, and libertie
indulged unto them, which served
as a farther argument to ensnare
this poor people in the belief of their
<i>Messiah</i>.</p>

<p>During this time of confinement,
<i>Sabatai</i> had leisure to compose and
institute a new method of Worship for
the <i>Jews</i>, and principally the manner
of the celebration of the day of his
<i>Nativity</i>, which he prescribed in this
manner.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Brethren, and my People, men of <i>Religion</i>

the renowned, where live men, and women,
and families; Peace be unto you
from the Lord of Peace, and from me
his beloved son, King <i>Salomon</i>. I command
you that the ninth day of the
Moneth of <i>Ab</i> (which according to our
account answered that year to the
Moneth of <i>June</i>) next to come, you
make a day of Invitation, and of great
Joy, celebrating it with choice meats
and pleasing drinks, with many Candles
and Lamps, with Musick and Songs,
because it is the day of the Birth of <i>Sabatai
Sevi</i>, the high King above all
kings of the Earth. And as to matters
of labour, and other things of like
nature, do, as becomes you, upon a day
of Festival, adorned with your finest
garments. As to your Prayers, let the
same order be used as upon Festivals.
To converse with <i>Christians</i> on that
day is unlawful, though your Discourse
be of matters indifferent, all labour is
forbidden, but to sound instruments is
lawful. This shall be the method and
substance of your Prayers on this day
of Festival: After you have said, Blessed
be thou, O holy God! then proceed
and say, Thou hast chosen us before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
all people, and hast loved us, and hast
been delighted with us, and hast humbled
us more than all other Nations, and
hast sanctified us with thy Precepts,
and hast brought us near to thy service,
and the service of our King. Thy holy,
great, and terrible Name thou hast
published amongst us: and hast given
us, O Lord God, according to thy love,
time of Joy, of Festivals, and times of
Mirth, and this day of Consolation
for a solemn Convocation of Holiness,
for the Birth of our King the <i>Messiah,
Sabatai Sevi</i> thy servant, and first-born
son in love, through whom we
commemorate our coming out of <i>Egypt</i>.
And then you shall read for your
Lesson the 1, 2, and 3 Chapters of
<i>Deut.</i> to the 17 verse, appointing for
the reading thereof five men, in a perfect
and uncorrupted Bible, adding
thereunto the Blessings of the Morning,
as are prescribed for days of Festival:
and for the Lesson out of the
Prophets usually read in the <i>Synagogue</i>
every <i>Sabbath</i>: you shall read the 31
Chapt. of <i>Jeremiah</i>. To your Prayer
called <i>Mussaf</i> (used in the <i>Synagogue</i>
every <i>Sabbath</i> and solemn Festival) you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
shall adjoyn that of the present Festival;
In stead of the sacrifice of Addition,
of the returning of the <i>Bible</i> to its
place, you shall read with an Audible
Voice, Clear Sound, the <i>Psalm</i> 95.
And at the first Praises in the Morning,
after you have Sang <i>Psalm</i> 91, and just
before you Sing <i>Psalm</i> 98, you shall repeate
<i>Psalm</i> 132 but in the last Verse,
where it is said, <i>As for his Enemies I
shall cloath them with shame, but upon
himself shall his Crown flourish</i>; in the
place of (<i>upon himself</i>) you shall read
<i>upon the most High</i>: after which shall
follow the 126 <i>Psalm</i>, and then the 113
to the 119.</p>

<p>At the Consecration of the Wine
upon the Vigil, or Even, you shall
make mention of the Feast of Consolation,
which is the day of the Birth of
our King the Messiah <i>Sabatai Sevi</i> thy
Servant, and First-born Son, giving the
Blessing as followeth: Blessed be thou
our God, King of the World, who hast
made us to live, and hast maintain'd us,
and hast kept us alive unto this time.
Upon the Eve of this day you shall
Read also the 81 <i>Psalm</i>, as also the 132
and 126 <i>Psalmes</i>, which are appointed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
for the Morning Praises. And this
day shall be unto you for a Remembrance
of a Solemn Day unto eternal
Ages, and a perpetual testimony between
me, and the Sons of <i>Israel</i>.<br /><br /></p>
</div>


<div class="center"><i>Audite Audiendo &amp; manducate bonam.</i></div>

<p>Besides which Order, and Method of
Prayers for Solemnization of his Birth,
he prescribed other Rules for Divine
Service, and particularly published the
same Indulgence and Priviledge to every
one who should Pray at the Tomb
of his Mother; as if he had taken on
him a Pilgrimage to Pray, and Sacrifice
at <i>Jerusalem</i>.</p>

<p>The Devotion of the <i>Jewes</i> toward
this pretended <i>Messiah</i> increased still
more and more, so that onely the Chief
of the City went to attend, and proffer
their service toward him in the time of
his Imprisonment, but likewise decked
their <i>Synagogue</i> with <i>S. S.</i> in Letters of
Gold, making for him on the Wall a
Crown, in the Circle of which was
wrote the 91 <i>Psalm</i> at length, in faire
and legible Characters; attributing the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
same titles to <i>Sabatai</i>, and Expounding
the <i>Scriptures</i> in the same manner in
favour of his Appearance, as we do of
our <i>Saviour</i>. However some of the
<i>Jewes</i> remain'd in their Wits all this
time, amongst which was a certain <i>Chocham</i>
at <i>Smyrna</i>, one zealous of his Law,
and of the good and safety of his Nation:
and observing in what a wilde
manner the whole People of the <i>Jewes</i>
was transported, with the groundless
beliefe of a <i>Messiah</i>, leaving not onely
their Trade, and course of living, but
publishing Prophesies of a speedy
Kingdome, of rescue from the Tyranny
of the <i>Turk</i>, and leading the Grand
<i>Signior</i> himself Captive in Chaines;
matters so dangerous and obnoxious to
the State wherein they lived, as might
justly convict them of Treason and Rebellion,
and leave them to the Mercy of
that Justice, which on the least jealousie
and suspicion of Matters of this nature,
uses to extirpate Families, and subvert
the Mansion-houses of their own People,
much rather of the <i>Jewes</i>, on whom
the <i>Turkes</i> would gladly take occasion
to dispoile them of their Estates, and
condemn the whole Nation to perpetual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
slavery. And indeed it would
have been a greater wonder then ever
<i>Sabatai</i> shewed, that the <i>Turkes</i> took
no advantage from all these extravagances,
to dreine the <i>Jewes</i> of a considerable
Sum of Money, and set their
whole Race in <i>Turky</i> at a Ransome, had
not these Passages yielded them matter
of Pastime, and been the Subject of
the <i>Turkes</i> Laughter and Scorne; supposing
it a Disparagement to the greatness
of the <i>Ottoman</i> Empire, to be concerned
for the Rumors and Combustions
of this Dispersed People. With
these considerations this <i>Chocham</i>, that
he might clear himself of the blood and
guilt of his Countrey-men, and concern'd
in the common destruction, goes
before the <i>Cadi</i>, and there protests against
the present Doctrine; Declaring,
that he had no hand in setting up
of <i>Sabatai</i>, but was an Enemy both to
him and to his whole Sect. This freedome
of the <i>Chocham</i> so enraged and
scandalized the <i>Jewes</i>, that they judged
no Condemnation or Punishment
too severe against such an Offender and
Blasphemer of their Law, and Holiness
of the <i>Messiah</i>; and therefore with Money<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
and Presents to the <i>Cadi</i>, accusing
him as Disobedient in a Capital nature
to their Government, obtain'd sentence
against him, to have his Beard shaved,
and to be condemn'd to the <i>Gallies</i>.
There wanted nothing now to the appearance
of the <i>Messiah</i>, and the solemnity
of his coming, but the presence
of <i>Elias</i>, whom the <i>Jewes</i> began to expect
hourely, and with that attention
and earnestness, that every Dreame, or
Phantasme to a weak head was judged
to be <i>Elias</i>; it being taught, and averred,
that he was seen in divers formes
and shapes, not to be certainly discovered
or known, before the coming of
the <i>Messiah</i>; for this superstition is so
far fixed amongst them, that generally
in their Families they spread a Table
for <i>Elias</i> the Prophet, to which they
make an Invitation of Poor people, leaving
the chief place for the Lord <i>Elias</i>,
whom they believe to be invisibly present
at the entertainment, and there to
Eate, and Drink, without dimunition,
either of the Dishes, or of the Cup.
One person amongst the <i>Jewes</i> commanded
his Wife after a supper of this
kind, to leave the Cup filled with Wine,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
and the Meat standing all night, for
<i>Elias</i> to Feast, and Rejoyce alone;
And in the morning arising early, affirmed,
that <i>Elias</i> took this Banquet so
kindly, that in token of gratitude, and
acceptance, he had replenish'd the Cup
with Oyle, in stead of Wine. It is a
certain Custome amongst the <i>Jewes</i> on
the Evening of the <i>Sabbath</i>, to repeate
certain Praises of God (called <i>Havdila</i>)
which signifies a distinction, or separation
of the Sabbath from the prophane
dayes (as they call them) which
Praises they observe to performe in this
manner. One takes a Cup filled with
Wine, and drops it through the whole
House, saying, <i>Elias</i> the Prophet, <i>Elias</i>
the Prophet, <i>Elias</i> the Prophet, come
quickly to us with the <i>Messiah</i>, the
<i>Son</i> of <i>God</i>, and <i>David</i>; and this they
affirme to be so acceptable to <i>Elias</i>,
that he never failes to preserve that family,
so devoted to him, and augment
it with the blessings of Increase. Many
other things the <i>Jewes</i> avouch of
<i>Elias</i>, so ridiculous, as are not fit to be
declar'd, amongst which this one is not
far from our purpose, that at the Circumcision
there is alwayes a Chair set<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
for <i>Elias</i>: And <i>Sabatai Sevi</i> being once
Invited at <i>Smyrna</i> to the Circumcision
of the First-borne Son of one <i>Abraham
Gutiere</i>, a Kinsman of <i>Sabatai</i>, and all
things ready for the Ceremony, <i>Sabatai
Sevi</i> exhorted the Parents of the
Child to expect a while until his farther
Order: After a good halfe hour, <i>Sabatai</i>
order'd them to proceed and cut the
<i>Prepuce</i> of the Child, which was instantly
perform'd with all joy and satisfaction
to the Parents: and being afterwards
demanded the reason why he retarded
the performance of that Function,
his answer was, That <i>Elias</i> had not as yet
taken his Seat, whom, as soon as he saw
placed, he ordered them to proceed; and
that now shortly <i>Elias</i> would discover
himself openly, and proclaime the newes
of the general Redemption.</p>

<p>This being the common Opinion amongst
the <i>Jewes</i>, and that <i>Sabatai
Sevi</i> was the <i>Messiah</i>, being become an
Article of Faith, it was not hard to perswade
them, that <i>Elias</i> was come already,
that they met him in their
Dishes, in the darke, in their Bed chambers,
or any where else invisible, in the
same manner as our common People in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
<i>England</i> believe of <i>Hobgoblins</i>, and
<i>Fairies</i>. For so it was, when <i>Solomon
Cremona</i>, an Inhabitant of <i>Smyrna</i>, making
a great Feast, to which the Principal
<i>Jewes</i> of the <i>City</i> were Invited, after
they had eaten and drank freely, one
starts from his Seat, and avouches, that
he saw <i>Elias</i> upon the Wall, and with
that bowes to him, and Complements
him with all Reverence and humility:
Some others having in like manner
their Fancies prepossessed, and their
Eyes with the Fume of Wine ill prepared
to distinguish shadowes, immediately
agreed upon the Object, and then
there was not one in the Company
who would say he did not see him: at
which surprize every one was struck
with reverence and awe; and the most
Eloquent amongst them, having their
Tongues loosed with Joy, and Wine,
directed <i>Orations</i>, <i>Encomiums</i>, and acts
of Thankfulness to <i>Elias</i>, courting and
complementing him, as distracted Lovers
doe the supposed presence of their
Mistresses. Another <i>Jew</i> at <i>Constantinople</i>
reported, that he met <i>Elias</i> in the
Streets, habited like a <i>Turke</i>, with
whom he had a long Communication;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
and that he enjoyn'd the Observation
of many neglected Ceremonies, and
particularly the <i>Zezit</i>, <i>Numb.</i> 15. <i>v.</i> 38.
<i>Speak unto the children of</i> Israel, <i>and bid
them that they make</i> Fringes <i>in the Borders
of their Garments, throughout their
Generations, and that they put upon the
Fringe of the Border a</i> Ribbon <i>of blue</i>.
Also the <i>Peos</i>, Levit. 19. v. 27. <i>Ye shall
not round the corners of your Head,
nor marr the corners of your Beard</i>: This
Apparition of <i>Elias</i> being believed as
soon as Published, every one began to
obey the Vision, by Fringing their
Garments; and for their Heads, though
alwayes shaved, according to the <i>Turkish</i>
and Eastern Fashion, and that the
suffering Hair to grow, to men not accustomed,
was heavy, and incommodious
to their healths and heads; yet to
begin again to renew, as far as was possible,
the antient Ceremonies, every one
nourished a lock of hair on each side,
which might be visible beneath their
Caps; which soon after began to be
a Sign of distinction between the <i>Believers</i>
and <i>Kophrims</i>, a name of dishonour,
signifying as much as <i>Unbelievers</i>;
or <i>Hereticks</i>, given to those who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
confessed not <i>Sabatai</i> to be the <i>Messiah</i>;
which particulars, if not observed,
it was declared, as a Menace of <i>Elias</i>,
that the People of the <i>Jewes</i>, who
come from the River <i>Sabation</i> as is specifyed
in the second <i>Esdras</i>, Chap. 13.
shall take vengeance of those who are
guilty of these Omissions.</p>

<p>But to return again to <i>Sabatai Sevi</i>
himself, we find him still remaining a
Prisoner in the <i>Castle</i> of <i>Abydos</i> upon
the <i>Hellespont</i>, admir'd and ador'd by his
Brethren, with more honor then before,
and visited by Pilgrimes from all parts
where the fame of the coming of the
<i>Messiah</i> had arriv'd; amongst which one
from <i>Poland</i>, named <i>Nehemiah Cohen</i>,
was of special note, and renown, learned
in the <i>Hebrew</i>, <i>Syriack</i>, and <i>Chaldee</i>,
and versed in the Doctrine and <i>Kabala</i>
of the <i>Rabines</i>, as well as <i>Sabatai</i> himself,
one (of whom it was said) had
not this <i>Sevi</i> anticipated the Design,
esteemed himself as able a Fellow to
Act the Part of a <i>Messiah</i> as the other:
Howsoever, it being now too late to
publish any such Pretence, <i>Sabatai</i> having
now eleven Points of the Law by
Possession of the Office, and with that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
the Hearts and Belief of the <i>Jewes</i>:
<i>Nehemiah</i> was contented with some
small appendage, or Relation to a
<i>Messiah</i>; and therefore to lay his Design
the better, desired a Private Conference
with <i>Sabatai</i>: These two great
Rabbines being together, a hot Dispute
arose between them; For <i>Cohen</i> alleadged
that according to Scripture, and Exposition
of the Learned thereupon, there
were to be two <i>Messiahs</i>, one called <i>Ben
Ephraim</i>, and the other <i>Ben David</i>: the
first was to be a Preacher of the <i>Law</i>,
poor, and despised, and a Servant of the
Second, and his Fore-runner; the other
was to be great and rich, to restore
the <i>Jewes</i> to <i>Jerusalem</i>, to sit
upon the Throne of <i>David</i>, and to performe
and act all those Triumphs and
Conquests which were expected from
<i>Sabatai</i>. <i>Nehemiah</i> was contented to
be <i>Ben Ephraim</i>, the afflicted and poor
<i>Messiah</i>; And <i>Sabatai</i> (for any thing
I hear) was well enough contented he
should be so: but that <i>Nehemiah</i> accused
him for being too forward in publishing
himself the latter <i>Messiah</i>, before
<i>Ben Ephraim</i> had first been known
unto the World. <i>Sabatai</i> took this reprehension<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
so ill, either out of pride,
and thoughts of his own infallibility,
or that he suspected <i>Nehemiah</i>, being
once admitted for <i>Ben Ephraim</i>, would
quickly (being a subtile and learned
person) perswade the World that he
was <i>Ben David</i>, would by no means understand,
or admit of this Doctrine, or
of <i>Ben Ephraim</i> for a necessary Officer:
And thereupon the Dispute grew so
hot, and the Controversie so irreconcileable,
as was taken notice of by the
<i>Jewes</i>, and controverted amongst them,
as every one fancy'd: But <i>Sabatai</i> being
of greater Authority, his Sentence
prevail'd, and <i>Nehemiah</i> was rejected,
as <i>Schismatical</i>, and an Enemy to the
<i>Messiah</i>, which afterward proved the
ruine and downfal of this <i>Impostor</i>.</p>

<p>For <i>Nehemiah</i> being thus baffled,
and being a person of Authority, and
a haughty Spirit, meditated nothing
but revenge; to execute which to the
full, he takes a Journey to <i>Adrianople</i>,
and there informes the Chief Ministers
of State, and Officers of the
Court, who (by reason of the gain
the <i>Turks</i> made of their Prisoner at the
<i>Castle</i> on the <i>Hellespont</i>) heard nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
of all this Concourse of People, and
Prophesies of the Revolt of the <i>Jews</i>
from their Obedience to the <i>Grand Signior</i>;
and taking likewise to his <i>Counsel</i>
some certain discontented and unbelieving
<i>Chochams</i>, who being zealous
for their Nation, and jealous of the ill-consequences
of this long-continued,
and increasing Madness, took liberty to
informe the <i>Chimacham</i> (who was Deputy
of the Great <i>Vizier</i> then at <i>Candia</i>)
that the <i>Jew</i>, Prisoner at the <i>Castle</i>,
called <i>Sabatai Sevi</i>, was a Lewd
Person, and one who indeavoured to
debauch the mindes of the <i>Jewes</i>, and
divert them from their honest course of
livelihood, and Obedience to the <i>Grand
Signior</i>; and that therefore it was necessary
to clear the World of so Factious
and dangerous a Spirit: The
<i>Chimacham</i> being thus informed, could
do no less then acquaint the <i>Grand Signior</i>
with all the particulars of this
Mans Condition, Course of Life, and
Doctrine; which were no sooner understood,
but a <i>Chiaux</i>, or <i>Messenger</i>,
was immediately dispatched, to bring
up <i>Sabatai Sevi</i> to <i>Adrianople</i>. The
<i>Chiaux</i> executed his Commission after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
the <i>Turkish</i> fashion in hast, and brought
<i>Sabatai</i> in a few days to <i>Adrianople</i>,
without further excuse or ceremony;
not affording him an hours space to
take a solemn farewel of his Friends,
his Followers and Adorers; who now
were come to the vertical point of all
their hopes and expectations.</p>

<p>The <i>Grand Signior</i> having by this
time received divers informations of
the madness of the <i>Jews</i>, and the pretences
of <i>Sabatai</i>; grew big with desire
and expectation to see him: so
that he no sooner arrived at <i>Adrianople</i>,
but the same hour he was brought
before the <i>Grand Signior</i>: <i>Sabatai</i> appeared
much dejected, and failing of
that courage which he shewed in the
<i>Synagogue</i>; and being demanded several
Questions in <i>Turkish</i> by the <i>Grand
Signior</i>, he would not trust so farr to the
vertue of his <i>Messiahship</i>, as to deliver
himself in the <i>Turkish Language</i>; but
desired a <i>Doctor</i> of <i>Physick</i>, (who had
from a <i>Jew</i> turned <i>Turk</i>,) to be his interpreter,
which was granted to him;
but not without reflection of the standers
by; that had he been the <i>Messiah</i>,
and <i>Son of God</i>, as he formerly pretended,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
his tongue would have flown with varietie,
as well as with the perfection of
Languages. But the <i>Grand Signior</i>
would not be put off without a <i>Miracle</i>,
and it must be one of his own choice:
which was, that <i>Sabatai</i> should be stript
naked, and set as a mark to his dexterous
Archers: if the Arrows passed
not his body, but that his flesh and
skin was proof like armour, then he
would believe him to be the <i>Messiah</i>,
and the person whom God had design'd
to those Dominions, and Greatnesses,
he pretended. But now <i>Sabatai</i>
not having faith enough to stand to
so sharp a trial, renounced all his title
to Kingdoms and Governments, alledging
that he was an ordinary
<i>Chocham</i>, and a poor <i>Jew</i>, as others were,
and had nothing of Priviledge, or Vertue
above the rest. The <i>Grand Signior</i>
notwithstanding, not wholly satisfied
with this plain confession, declared, that
having given publique scandal to the
Professors of the <i>Mahometan</i> religion,
and done dishonour to his Soveraign
authoritie, by pretending to draw such
a considerable portion from him, as the
Land of <i>Palestine</i>; his treason and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
crime was not to be expiated by any
other means then by a conversion to
the <i>Mahometan</i> faith, which if he refus'd
to do, the stake was ready at the gate
of the <i>Seraglio</i> to empale him. <i>Sabatai</i>
being now reduced to extremitie of
his latter game; not being the least
doubtful what to do; for to die for
what he was assured was false, was
against nature, and the death of a mad
man: replyed with much chearfulness,
that he was contented to turn <i>Turk</i>,
and that it was not of force, but of
choice, having been a long time desirous
of so glorious a Profession, he
esteemed himself much honored, that
he had opportunity to own it; first in
the presence of the <i>Grand Signior</i>. And
here was the <i>non plus ultra</i> of all the
bluster and noise of this vain Impostor.
And now the <i>Reader</i> may be pleased
to pause a while and contemplate the
strange point of consternation, shame,
and silence, to which the <i>Jews</i> were
reduc't, when they understood how
speedily their hopes were vanished, and
how poorly and ignominiously all their
fancies and promises of a new Kingdom,
their <i>Pageantry</i>, and Offices of Devotion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
were past like a tale, or a midnights
dream: And as this was concluded,
and the <i>Jews</i> sunk on a sudden, and
fallen flat in their hopes, without so
much as a line of comfort, or excuse
from <i>Sabatai</i>; more than in general,
to all the brethren. That now they
should apply themselves to their Callings
and services of God, as formerly,
for that matters relating unto him
were finished and the sentence past.
The news that <i>Sabatai</i> was turned
<i>Turk</i>, and the <i>Messiah</i> to a <i>Mahumetan</i>,
quickly filled all parts of <i>Turky</i>. The
<i>Jews</i> were strangely surprized at it, and
ashamed of their easie belief, of the
arguments with which they had perswaded
one the other, and of the Proselytes
they had made in their own families.
Abroad they became the common
derision of the Towns where
they inhabited: the Boys shouted after
them, coyning a new word at <i>Smyrna</i>
(<i>Ponftai</i>) which every one seeing a
<i>Jew</i>, with a finger pointed out, would
pronounce with scorn and contempt:
so that this deceived people for a long
time after remained with confusion, silence,
and dejection of spirit. And yet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
most of them affirm that <i>Sabatai</i> is not
turned <i>Turk</i>, but his shadow onely remains
on earth, and walks with a white
head, and in the habit of a <i>Mahumetan</i>:
but that his natural body and soul are
taken into heaven, there to reside until
the time appointed for accomplishment
of these wonders: and this opinion
began so commonly to take place, as
if this people resolved never to be undeceived,
using the forms and rules for
Devotion prescribed them by their <i>Mahumetan
Messiah</i>: Insomuch that the
<i>Chochams</i> of <i>Constantinople</i>, fearing the
danger of this error might creep up, and
equal the former, condemned the belief
of <i>Sabatai</i> being <i>Messiah</i>, as damnable,
and enjoyned them to return to
the antient Method and Service of
God upon pain of <i>Excommunication</i>.
The style and tenure of them was as
followeth.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>During the time of all these transactions
and passages at <i>Constantinople</i>,
<i>Smyrna</i>, <i>Abydos</i>, upon the <i>Helespont</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
and <i>Adrianople</i>, the <i>Jews</i> leaving their
Merchantile course, and advices, what
prizes commodities bear and matters
of Traffique, stuffed their Letters for
<i>Italy</i> and other parts, with nothing but
wonders and miracles wrought by their
false <i>Messiah</i>. As then when the <i>Grand
Signior</i> sent to take him, he caused all
the Messengers immediately to die, upon
which other <i>Janizaries</i> being again
sent, they all fell dead with a word only
from his mouth; and being desired
to revive them again, he immediately
recall'd them to life; but of them onely
such who were true <i>Turks</i>, and not
those who had denied that faith in
which they were born, and had profest.
After this they added, that he went
voluntarily to prison, and though the
gates were barr'd and shut with strong
Locks of Iron, yet that <i>Sabatai</i> was
seen to walk through the streets with
a numerous attendance, and when
they laid Shackles on his neck and
feet, they not onely fell from him,
but were converted into Gold, with
which he gratified his true and faithful
believers and disciples. Some Miracles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
also were reported of <i>Nathan</i>,
that onely at reading the name of
any particular man, or woman, he
would immediately recount the Story
of his, or her life, their sins or defaults,
and accordingly impose just correction
and penance for them. These strong
reports coming thus confidently into
<i>Italy</i> and all parts, the <i>Jews</i> of <i>Casel
di Monferrato</i> resolved to send three
persons in behalf of their society, in
the nature of extraordinary <i>Legates</i>,
to <i>Smyrna</i>, to make inquiry after the
truth of all these rumors, who accordingly
arriving in <i>Smyrna</i>, full of
expectation and hopes, intending to
present themselves with great Humility
and Submission before their <i>Messiah</i>
and his Prophet <i>Nathan</i>, were entertain'd
with the sad news, that <i>Sabatai</i>
was turned <i>Turk</i>, by which information
the Character of their <i>Embassy</i>
in a manner ceasing, every one
of them laying aside the formalitie
of his function, endeavoured to lodge
himself best to his own convenience.
But that they might return
to their brethren at home, with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
certain particulars of the Success of
the affairs, they made a visit to the
brother of <i>Sabatai</i>; who still continued
to perswade them, that <i>Sabatai</i>
was notwithstanding the true <i>Messiah</i>,
that it was not he who had taken
on him the habit and form of a
<i>Turk</i>, but his <i>Angel</i> or <i>Spirit</i>, his body
being ascended into Heaven, until
God shall again see the season,
and time to restore it, adding further,
that an effect hereof they should
see by the prophet <i>Nathan</i>, certified,
now every day expected, who having
wrought <i>Miracles</i> in many places,
would also for their Consolation,
reveal hidden secrets unto them,
with which they should not onely
remain satisfied, but astonished. With
this onely hope of <i>Nathan</i>, these <i>Legates</i>
were a little comforted, resolving
to attend his arrival, in regard
they had a Letter to consign into his
hands, and according to their instructions,
were to demand of him the
grounds he had for his Prophesies,
and what assurance he had, that he
was divinely inspir'd, and how these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
things were reveal'd unto him, which
he had committed to Paper, and dispersed
to all parts of the World. At
length <i>Nathan</i> arrives near <i>Smyrna</i>,
on Friday the third of <i>March</i>, towards
the Evening, and on <i>Sunday</i>
these <i>Legates</i> made their visit to
him: But <i>Nathan</i>, upon news of the
success of his beloved <i>Messiah</i>, began
to grow sullen and reserved; So
that the <i>Legates</i> could scarce procure
admittance to him; all that
they could do was to inform him,
that they had a Letter to him from
the brother-hood of <i>Italy</i>, and commission
to conferr with him concerning
the foundation and authority he
had for his prophesies; but <i>Nathan</i>
refused to take the Letter, ordering
<i>Kain Abolafio</i> a <i>Chocham</i> of the City
of <i>Smyrna</i> to receive it; so that the
<i>Legates</i> returned ill contented, but
yet with hopes at <i>Nathan</i>'s arrival
at <i>Smyrna</i> to receive better satisfaction.</p>

<p>But whilst <i>Nathan</i> intended to
enter into <i>Smyrna</i>, the <i>Chochams</i> of
<i>Constantinople</i>, being before advised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
of his resolution to take a Journey
into their parts, not knowing by which
way he might come, sent their Letters
and Orders to <i>Smyrna</i>, <i>Prussia</i>,
and every way round, to hinder his
passage, and interrupt his journey;
fearing that things beginning now to
compose, the <i>Turks</i> appeas'd for the
former disorders, and the minds of
the <i>Jews</i> in some manner setled, might
be moved, and combustions burst out
afresh, by the appearance of this
new <i>Impostor</i>; And therefore dispatched
this Letter as followeth.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>


<div class="blockquot"><p><i>To you who are the Shepherds
of Israel, and Rulers, who
reside for the great God of the
whole World, in the</i> Citie <i>of</i>
Smyrna, <i>which is</i> Mother <i>in</i>
Israel, <i>to her Princes, her
Priests, her Judges, and especially
to the perfect wise men,
and of great experience, may
the Lord God cause you to live
before him, and delight in the
multitude of Peace</i>, Amen, <i>so
be the will of the Lord</i>.</p>

<p>These our Letters are dispatched
unto you, to let
you understand, that in the
place of your Holiness, we
have heard that the learned
man, which was in <i>Gaza</i>, called
<i>Nathan</i>, <i>Benjamin</i>, hath published<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
Vaine Doctrines, and
made the World Tremble at
his Words and Inventions; And
that at this time we have receiv'd
Advice, that this man
some dayes since, departed from
<i>Gaza</i>, and took his Journey by
the way of <i>Scanderone</i>, intending
there to Imbarke for <i>Smyrna</i>,
and thence to go to <i>Constantinople</i>,
or <i>Adrianople</i>: And
though it seem a strange thing
unto us, that any Man should
have a desire to throw himself
into a place of Flames, and Fire,
and into the Sparkes of <i>Hell</i>;
notwithstanding we ought to
fear, and suspect it; <i>For the
Feet of Man alwayes guide him
to the worst</i>: Wherefore we
Under-written do Advertise
you, that this Man coming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
within the compass of your Jurisdiction,
you give a stop to
his Journey, and not suffer
him to proceed farther, but
presently to return back. For
we would have you know, that
at his coming, he will again
begin to move those Tumults,
which have been caused through
the Imaginations of a New
Kingdome; <i>And that Miracles
are not to be Wrought every
day</i>.</p>

<p>God forbid that by his coming
the People of God should
be destroy'd in all places where
they are, of which he will be
the first, whose Blood be upon
his own Head: For in this
Conjuncture, every little Error
or Fault is made Capital. You
may remember the Danger of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
the first Combustion: And it is
very probable that he will be
an occasion of greater, which
the Tongue is not able to express
with Words. And therefore
by Vertue of Ours, and
Your own Authority, you are
to hinder him from proceeding
farther in his Journey, upon
paine of all those Excommunications
which Our <i>Law</i>
can Impose, and to force him
to return back again, both he,
and his Company. But if he
shall in any manner Oppose
you, and Rebel against your
Word, your Indeavours and
Law are sufficient to hinder him,
for it will be well for him and
all <i>Israel</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>For the Love of God, let
these Words enter into your
Eares, since they are not vain
things; for the Lives of all the
<i>Jewes</i>, and his also, consist
therein. And the Lord God
behold from Heaven, and have
pitty upon his People <i>Israel</i>,
Amen. So be his holy Will:
Written by those who seek
your Peace.</p>

and partly ashamed of the event of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
Things contrary to his Prophesie, was
resolved, without entring <i>Smyrna</i>, to
returne again: Howsoever he obtained
leave to visit the <i>Sepulcher</i> of his <i>Mother</i>,
and there to receive Pardon of his
Sins (according to the Institution of
<i>Sabatai</i> before mentioned) but first
washed himself in the Sea, in manner
of Purification, and said his <i>Tephilla</i>,
or <i>Prayers</i>, at the Fountain, called
by us the Fountain <i>Sancta Veneranda</i>,
which is near to the <i>Cymetry</i> of the
<i>Jewes</i>, and then departed for <i>Zion</i>
with two Companions, a Servant, and
three <i>Turks</i>, to conduct him, without
admitting the <i>Legates</i> to Audience,
or answering the Letter which was
sent him, from all the Communities
of the <i>Jewes</i> in <i>Italy</i>. And thus the
Embassy of these Legates was concluded,
and they returned from the
place from whence they came, and the
<i>Iewes</i> again to their Wits, following
their Trade of Merchandize and Brokage
as formerly, with more quiet,
and advantage, then the meanes of regaining
their Possessions in the Land
of Promise. And thus ended this mad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
<i>Phrensie</i> amongst the <i>Iewes</i>, which
might have cost them dear, had not
<i>Sabatai</i> Renounce't his <i>Messiaship</i> at
the Feet of <i>Mahomet</i>.</p>

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be

individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are

copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by

this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with

keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any

     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with

If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
